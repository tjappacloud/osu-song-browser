# osu! Song Browser

A fast, thumbnail-rich browser for your osu! `Songs` folder. Play tracks, manage playlists, and view listening stats.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

	```powershell
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	```
    
2. Run the app:
	```powershell
	python main.py
	```

## Highlights

- Thumbnail list: Song list uses a Treeview with per-item thumbnails sourced from `.osu` backgrounds or folder images.
- Disk thumbnail cache: Thumbnails are saved under `~/.osu_song_browser_thumbs` for instant loading on subsequent runs.
- Actions dropdown: Top-row Menubutton with key actions:
	- Browse…
	- Scan Now
	- Clear Thumbs (wipes disk and memory caches; regenerates as needed)
	- Stats
	- Dark Mode toggle
- Dark mode: Theme-switching is stable and no longer inflates font sizes on repeated toggles.
- Larger visuals: Configured larger thumbnails (default now 96×96), widened columns, and increased row height for readability.

## Playlists

- Create playlists, add selected songs, and play sequentially or shuffled.
- Compact playlist panel with tracks list and inline status messages.

## Stats Page

- Persistent stats stored at `~/.osu_song_browser_stats.json`:
	- Play count per song
	- Time listened (seconds accumulated)
	- Last played timestamp
- Stats window includes:
	- Columns: Title, Plays, Time Listened, Last Played
	- Sorting: Click any column header to sort (numeric/time aware)
	- Filter: Live title filter box to narrow results

## Searching

- Main list search matches folder title, tag title, and artist (case-insensitive substring).

## Performance

- Asynchronous thumbnail generation to keep UI responsive.
- Disk cache ensures thumbnails appear immediately on subsequent launches.

## Notes

- Audio playback via `pygame`; UI built with `tkinter`/`ttk` and images via Pillow.
- Metadata combines ID3 tags with folder-name parsing when tags are missing.
- If you want to regenerate thumbnails at a new size, use Actions → Clear Thumbs.

## Controls

### Playback

- **Play**: Start playing selected song
- **Pause/Resume**: Toggle pause state
- **Stop**: Stop playback
- **Progress Bar**: Click or drag to seek to specific position

### Play Modes

- **Sequential**: Play songs in order
- **Loop**: Repeat current track
- **Shuffle**: Play random songs from entire library

### Other

- **Browse**: Change songs directory
- **Scan Now**: Manually trigger directory rescan
- **Search**: Filter songs by title, artist, or album
- **Min length**: Set minimum duration threshold (in seconds)
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes
- **Escape**: Toggle fullscreen/windowed mode

## Configuration

The application automatically detects your osu! Songs directory at:
```
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\osu!\Songs
```

You can change this by clicking the "Browse..." button.

### Minimum Duration

By default, songs shorter than 30 seconds are excluded. You can adjust this in the UI or by modifying `MIN_DURATION_SECONDS` in `config.py`.

### Cache Location

Song metadata is cached at:
```
~/.osu_mp3_browser_cache.json
```

This speeds up subsequent launches by avoiding re-scanning all files.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Escape**: Toggle between maximized and windowed mode
- **Enter** (in min length field): Apply new duration filter
- **Double-click** (on song): Play selected song

## Troubleshooting

### Audio doesn't play

- Ensure pygame is installed: `pip install pygame`
- Check that your audio files are in supported formats (.mp3, .ogg)

### No songs appear

- Verify your osu! Songs directory exists and contains beatmaps
- Click "Scan Now" to manually trigger a rescan
- Check the console for error messages

### Thumbnails don't show

- Install Pillow: `pip install pillow`
- Ensure .osu files contain valid background image references

### Metadata is missing

- Install mutagen for better tag extraction: `pip install mutagen`
- Some metadata may be parsed from folder names as fallback
